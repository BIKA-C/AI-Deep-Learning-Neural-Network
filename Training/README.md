The neural network I made could not handle the massive inputs. (But it works! A demo is provided in its release folder). Folder LeNet contains source code provided by 范文捷 (WenJie Fan). He uses the CNN method based on Yann Lecun's paper "Gradient-based Learning Applied To Document Recognition"

I used his code to train the model.
